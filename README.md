# 2D-ADE-SOLVER
This is the python code for solving 2D Advection Diffusion Transport Equation with the FVM 
A generalised scheme is imlemented for discretization for advection term, which is accuracte of 2nd order for moderate elemental Peclet no.

Note: Avoid using it for too high or use fine mesh
